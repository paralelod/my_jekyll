		<h1>Tomek Setowski</h1>

	<p>Images of dream, fantasy and play. Horns, jester's bells, chessboard floors, cartwheel ruffs, cards and queens, masks and moon faces, fantastical flying contraptions, pirate ships on the ropes of hot air balloons, arching towers of Babylon expanding into the stratosphere and topped by the bust of a woman or magistrate. The mysteries of the underwater world—lost Atlantis cities thriving in the depths of the sea—mingle with the creatures on land. A layering of people and architecture. One object woven into the next. Tomek Setowski’s multidisciplinary art involves a never-ending transformation of image waxing out of image with the imagination of Don Quixote: fantastic and grand. He molds stately, never before seen creatures out of the vast landscape of his mind, figures that are recognizable from the echoes of our dreams.</p>

 	<h3>Milestones for Surrealism in Poland</h3>
	<p>Born in 1961 in Czestochowa, Poland, Setowski attended the Czestochowa Pedagogical University and graduated from the Faculty of Fine Arts in 1989. His work appeared in the 1995 exhibition entitled “Polish Surrealists” and gained international success in 1998 after catching the attention of Stricoff Fine Arts at the New York art fair. Later the CFM Gallery presented his works next to those of Salvador Dali, Leonor Fini and Michael Parkes. He’s also had shows in Germany, France, Austria, Poland, Italy, and Switzerland, and Setowski’s work has most recently been shown in Burj Al Arab, at the Abu Dhabi Cultural Foundation, and in the Emirat Towers in the UAE.</p>

	<h3>Legends of Wonderland</h3>
	<p>Specializing in what some would call surrealism and others magical or fantastic realism, the artist extends his imagination into the realms of painting, drawing, graphics, sculpture, gouache, street art, and even jewelry. The Polish artist creates Alice in Wonderland type scenes rich in symbolism. He fills his canvases and paper with a mixture of larger than life characters soon to be legends. His beautiful people appear like an anggitay or centaur with a dress or cloak of an ancient city. And these medieval cities, with their jesters and rouges, are given a mechanical aspect; contraptions harkening back to those of Leonardo de Vinci speckle the sea and the sky, exaggerating man’s march of time and progress while being caught in the hues of timeless fantasy. His images are full of representations of man’s quest for exploration and wonder.</p>
	<div class="ui section divider"></div>
	<h3>Dream Factory</h3>
	<p>In his home town of Czestochowa Setowski has created a combination gallery and studio called the “Museum of Imagination” where he creates and displays his fairytale work. With his Dali-like concept of depth perception and shading, Setowski’s oil painting characters float above the background like two-dimensional cutout paper dolls. They drag their own shadows with them into the vast dreamscape of the geometric scene. His drawings are like light, playful sketches for his oil creations while being obvious finished pieces in their own right. And the gouache pieces are a mixture of his drawings and oil style, both free flowing like the quick stroke of a pencil and intricate and colorful like his careful brush. The sculptures out of bronze, wood, and metal bring his paintings and drawings to life as they transpose details of Setowski’s two-dimensional creatures into three-dimensional pieces. These creations appear as if they’ve crawled off the page or out of the canvas to become the tangible, touchable stuff of dreams.</p>
