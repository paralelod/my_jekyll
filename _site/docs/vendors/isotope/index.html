                            <p class="description">Do you want to become a web developer? Nowadays, web development isn't one job. There is a range of technologies and career options to explore. The core responsibilities are split two ways—between front-end developers who specialize in websites and applications and back-end developers who work with servers and databases—but you can also become a full-stack developer who oversees all aspects of a project. This course provides an overview of the different jobs available in web development, the tools and frameworks to focus on, and the skills each job entails. Senior staff author Ray Villalobos also provides tips on finding training, getting hired, and maximizing your earning potential in this lucrative and exciting field.</p>

Simon Allardice uses JavaScript to explore the core syntax of a programming language, and shows how to write and execute your first application and understand what's going on under the hood. The course covers creating small programs to explore conditions, loops, variables, and expressions; working with different kinds of data and seeing how they affect memory; writing modular code; and how to debug, all using different approaches to constructing software applications.</p>

                            <p class="description">Once you get past simplistic computer programs with one or two variables, you'll use a data structure to store the values—and groups of values— in your applications. While they are sometimes taken for granted in modern programming environments, a deeper understanding of data structures is vital for any programmer who wants to know what's going on "under the hood" and understand how to defend the choices they've made for performance and efficiency. Simon Allardice offers that understanding to you in this Foundations of Programming course.</p>

                            <p class="description">The course shows how to use Git, the popular open-source version control software, to manage changes to source code and text files. Using a step-by-step approach, author Kevin Skoglund presents the commands that enable efficient code management and reveals the fundamental concepts behind version control systems and the Git architecture. Discover how to track changes to files in a repository, review previous edits, and compare versions of a file; create branches to test new ideas without altering the main project; and merge those changes into the project if they work out. The course begins by demonstrating version control in a single-user, standalone context, before exploring how remote repositories allow users to collaborate on projects effectively.</p>

Frameworks speed up development, enhance collaboration, and help keep code organized. So why start from scratch? In this course, Drew Falkman introduces the six most popular PHP frameworks: Zend, Symfony, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Yii, and Laravel. He'll describe each framework's advantages, show how to get and install the software, and then demonstrate how to get the default pages for each framework up and running, so viewers can see how the code is structured. In the final chapter, Drew compares all the frameworks and provides resources to move forward with each one. Your framework choice is one of the biggest factors affecting the success of your project; start here to get the information you need to make the right decision.</p>

                            <p class="description">Web projects need to work across multiple devices, screen sizes, and browsing contexts. Web designs need to be responsive to these variables, providing an optimal viewing experience for each scenario. In this course, author James Williamson introduces responsive design to new web designers and fills in any gaps experienced designers may have, while providing a deeper exploration of how current trends in devices, connectivity, and user experience are driving its adoption. The course covers concepts like screen density, fluid grids, and responsive images, as well as actual design strategies that guide you from mock-up to testing.</p>

To go further and get full control, you need child themes. A WordPress child theme is a mini-theme that piggybacks off an existing theme. This means rather than writing all the code from scratch, you just write a new child of an original parent theme, updating only the parts you want.</p>

This series of training videos explains basic programming concepts by relating them to real-life objects, actions, and scenarios. Each video will focus on a different analogy, mixing live action with segments that demonstrate the concepts in code. For example, Barron Stone connects functions to recipes, lists to parking spaces, and loops to that perpetual chore: dishwashing. He illustrates most of the examples using Python, but you can follow along in any language you choose.</p>

But some problems are a little difficult to solve using 100% pure JavaScript. jQuery closes most of the gaps, and does it so well that a huge number of developers now use jQuery to create some of the coolest front-end plugins around.

It features real-world examples and some easily learned best practices, while covering jQuery basics such as functions, classes, event binding, and data manipulation.

Sass is the adopted and widely supported CSS compiler for WordPress, which allows you to use variables, mixins, and nesting to write simpler code. In this course Morten Rand-Hendriksen covers practical workflows for incorporating Sass into the development of a WordPress theme, along with Grunt.js, a task runner that translates Sass code into browser-friendly CSS. First Morten walks the viewer through a full production setup, including implementation of version control, Grunt.js, Ruby, and Sass on Windows and Mac. Then he'll present practical workflows for developing a custom theme (based on the _s or Underscores theme) with Sass and shipping "pure CSS" versions to the public.</p>

                            <p class="description">Open a world of new WordPress possibilities by writing your own plugins. Carrie Dils teaches you how to create custom functionality for WordPress using the Plugin API and a little bit of PHP. First, get a background in the basics of WordPress plugins—how to install them, manage them, find them, and write them—and understand when to use a plugin vs. a custom theme. Next, learn how to develop a plugin with the Plugin API, writing hooks (including actions and filters) to attach your new functionality to WordPress.</p>

                            <p class="description">Have you wondered if using a CSS framework will speed up your website development? Frameworks give you the files and assets you need to build most websites—giving you a head start on your design process and templates for producing better, more consistent code. But they're not right for every project. Carrie Dils introduces the types of frameworks available, including the most popular open-source options like Bootstrap and Foundation, and provides an honest assessment of their pros and cons. She guides you through the download and setup steps and helps you build a basic framework-based site. Chapter 5 explores CSS grid systems, including Flexbox and Grid (the CSS Grid Layout module), which provide a simple system for laying out page content in columns and rows.</p>
